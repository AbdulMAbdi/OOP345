  Reflection on what I have learned from doing this workshop 
 ============================================================================
*/


What I learned from doing this workshop: 
In doing this workshop I was able to learn how to implement a vector container to store a set of pointers. By using a vector container I was able to more easily add, delete and grew the size of the set of pointers as opposed to using an array. Throughout doing this workshop I was also able to gain more experience in using enumerations and class variables in my class. In the classes I coded for this project I was able to use an enumeration to identify the tax status of an object and was able to store the according rates in a class variable. 


Question 1: 
In this workshop the vector container was used because it is the closest to an array making it more effecient than a deque container. Since are code design does not require adding and removing data from both ends of the set , the vector container was the best choice. 

Question 2: 
We did not need to worry about deallocation of memory in our code because the vector container has the ability to destroy the objects it contains after it leaves scope. 

Question 3: 
By using the range based for in our code we do not be concern about indices (i.e product[i]) and instead can just iterate over the whole range of the vector container by reference to the adress that the container holds. 


Quiz 6 Reflection


1. The algorithms category of the STL consists of the following three libraries: Containers, Iterators, Algorithms

2. Complete the statement that creates a function object named foo by binding the function named add to the arguments 10 and 20:
auto foo = std::bind(add, 10, 20); 
 
3. The iterators of the standard template library divide into six categories. Name two of them: Input Iterator, Output Iterator
 
4. The transform function templates of the STL perform programmer-specified operations on the elements of a sequential container. 

5. Complete the statement that sums the elements of int array a and returns the result:
      int result = std::accumulate ( a.begin() , a.end() , 0); 
 
6. Write a program that reads the first 10 bytes from a binary file named file and displays them on standard output: 

#include <iostream>
#include 

int main() {
    

     char str[11];
     char* p = str;

     std::ifstream f("file", std::ios::in|std::ios::binary); 

     while(f)
         f.read(p++, 1);
     *--p = '\0';

     std::cout << str << std::endl;
}
